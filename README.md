This is an Rstudio project housing our analyses of parentage (and sibling inference) of rockfish using our GTseq data off the MiSeq.

The full genotype data don't live in this repo, since that would be too much for GitHub, but, the code for the early data processing steps is set up as if you have them in a directory called `extdata` in this repository. The `data` directory here holds the meta data information for the individuals, and the plate maps that we use to associate the IDs from the genotyping data with all the metadata.
